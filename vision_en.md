# NSUTS for VS Code

## Problematic

> nsuts is a testing system for conducting and verifying Olympiads.

In our first year, we faced to several issues when working with the current system. The main of them is that you have to often open a web browser to submit solutions, which slows down the workflow.

In terms of Olympiad programming, every minute counts â€” the time spent on technical manipulation could be used to solve problems. That is why we propose to implement VS Code extension, which will allow you to work in a familiar development environment and save time switching between windows.
